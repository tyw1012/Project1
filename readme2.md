### About this project
This is the visualization of **world militarized interstate disputes (MID) and interstate wars** during the post world war II era until the fall of the Soviet Union (1946 - 1991). The definition and typology of MID/War follow those of [The Correlates of War Project](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/). The visualization is designed mainly for exploring diplomatic relationships between countries over time implied through the history of militarized disputes they were involved.

#### Data source
World MID data sets provided by *The Correlates of War Project* :

* [Militarized Interstate Disputes (v4.1)](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/MIDs)
* [Militarized Interstate Dispute Locations (v1.1)](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/MIDLOC) 

GIS vector data sets which preserve states' historical border lines:
 
*  [Cshapes](http://nils.weidmann.ws/projects/cshapes.html) 

For the linkage between the interstate wars (simultaneously coded as MIDs) and MIDs:

*  [Relationship between MIDs and Wars](http://cow.la.psu.edu/COW2%20Data/MIDs/Mapping%20of%20MIDs%20and%20Wars.pdf)

#### Notice
 
* The mapped geographic location **represents the onset of each individual MID.** 
* Some of the MID/war data records the geographic coordinates as missing, hence some disputes have no corresponding circle on the map (left), but only in the time-line board (right).
