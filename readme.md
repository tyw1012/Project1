### About this project
This is the visualization of **world militarized interstate disputes (MID) and interstate wars** during the post world war II era until the fall of the Soviet Union (1946 - 1991). The definition and typology of MID/War follow those of [The Correlates of War Project](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/). The visualization is designed mainly for exploring state-to-state diplomatic tension over time through investigating the history of militarized interactions among them.

#### Data source
World MID data sets provided by *The Correlates of War Project* :

* [Militarized Interstate Disputes (v4.1)](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/MIDs)
* [Militarized Interstate Dispute Locations (v1.1)](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/MIDLOC) 

GIS vector data sets which preserve states' historical border lines:
 
*  [Cshapes](http://nils.weidmann.ws/projects/cshapes.html) 

For the linkage between the interstate wars (simultaneously coded as MIDs) and MIDs:

*  [Relationship between MIDs and Wars](http://cow.la.psu.edu/COW2%20Data/MIDs/Mapping%20of%20MIDs%20and%20Wars.pdf)


#### Notice
 
* The geographic location marked with circle **represents the onset of each individual MID.** 

* MID and Interstate War are not necessarily mutually exclusive event. For more information, See [the COW typology of War](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/COW-war/the-cow-typology-of-war-defining-and-categorizing-wars/view) and [this document](http://cow.la.psu.edu/COW2%20Data/MIDs/Development/Jones,Bremer,Singer.PDF).

	*- When militarized interstate disputes evolve, or escalate, to the point where military combat is sufficiently sustained that it will result in a minimum of 1,000 total battle deaths (Small and Singer, 1982), they become interstate wars.*

* Some of the MID/war data records the geographic coordinates as missing, hence some disputes have no corresponding circle marked on the map (left), but only in the time-line board (right).
